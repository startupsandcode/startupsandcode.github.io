Just learning about Jekyll and github pages, and thought I'd play. :-)  Ok, it is pretty cool what you can do.

I'm a c# developer with some crazy love for JavaScript and front-end work.  I even can do email html design, yeah, tables, tables, tables (and it works in outlook too!)

I'm just playing right now and learning more and more.  Special thanks to @BigNerdRanch for the inspiration and help.


Here are some notes for me to remember when I post with Jekyll.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
